# online-shopping-with-advanced-admin-page
Updated version


online shopping system with both admin and user layouts.


Project was to build a shopping cart app which can handle the following:
1. Product based discounts
2. Shipping charges at shopping cart value

Assumptions:
1. Data for the discounts and shipping charges uploaded separately
2. These are stored in a database table to ensure they can be updated separately




 Intent here was to :
a. highlight building functionality quickly
b. Proving knowledge across different technologies
c. Knowledge of database and design handling the same
d. Being able to understand an existing legacy application and
   quickly understand and revise the same to provide new 
   functionality
